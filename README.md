## About

- Excel uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) algorithm (MT19937) to generate random numbers. 
- RAND() - A random number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1
- RANDBETWEEN(bottom, top) - Returns a random integer between the numbers specified 
- [NORM.INV( probability, mean, standard_dev )](https://www.excelfunctions.net/excel-norm-inv-function.html) - calculates the inverse of the Cumulative Normal Distribution Function for a supplied value of x, and a supplied distribution mean & standard deviation.

## Normal Distribution

A continuous probability function given by the formula:

![formula](https://www.excelfunctions.net/image-files/Normal_Probability_Density_Function.PNG)

where: 
- μ is the mean 
- σ2 is the variance (standard deviation squared)
- x is the independent variable for which to evaluate the function

The Cumulative Normal Distribution function is given by the integral, from -∞ to x, of the Normal Probability Density function.
